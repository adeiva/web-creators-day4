CIS 151 Web Design Homework 4


This assignment is on p.153 in the Morris text. Ignore task 1. I have introduced the following additional tasks:

1) Use the hwk4Starter.zip file for this assignment. Unzip the files into a directory called "cis151Hwk4".
   
2) Create a directory called "images". Move all image files into that directory.

3) Create a directory called "css". Move the javajam.css file into that directory.

4) Modify the links to the stylesheet in all html files so that they can locate the javajam.css file.

5) Remove the <i><small> tags from the footer in all html files.

6) Add style rules to the footer style definition in the stylesheet to produce the same effect as the 
   tags removed in step 5.

7) Now complete Task 2 to Task 5, starting on p153. Remember, all references to image files must have the 
   correct path:  path/filename. All image files are located by the path:  images/filename, relative
   to the html pages.
